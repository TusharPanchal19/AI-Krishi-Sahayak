🌾 AI Krishi Sahayak
AI-Based Government Scheme Recommendation System for Farmers
📌 Overview

AI Krishi Sahayak is an AI-powered agriculture assistance platform designed to help farmers identify the most suitable government schemes based on their eligibility and farming conditions. The system analyzes farmer information such as landholding size, income category, crop type, location, and social category to recommend schemes that best match the farmer’s profile.

In addition to scheme recommendations, the platform includes an AI chatbot that answers farmer queries related to government schemes, eligibility rules, and general agricultural guidance using Google Gemini.
